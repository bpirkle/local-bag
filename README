== LocalBag ==

LocalBag is a small MediaWiki extension to facilitate local development.
It is simply a place to stuff whatever code may be helpful, normally by
implementing a MediaWiki hook.

Its name was inspired by the MediaWiki class BagOStuff.

If anyone finds it useful, that's great.  But it was created as a personal
project, and it is very much tied to the author's local development setup.
